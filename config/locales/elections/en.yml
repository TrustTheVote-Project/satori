        <p>Performing election analytics and reporting is an easy process that uses raw data from your existing voter records system:</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, upload two kinds of existing data, using a Common Data Format.</li>
            <li>Then, choose which automatically generated report to view.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Your initial view of each report is a web page with tabular statistics.
        However, you can download and save each report as a CSV file.  Coming soon,
        you will be able to choose a format for later viewing including standalone
        HTML or PDF.</p>

        <p>Below, the "<strong>Status</strong>" section provides the current status of the reporting
        so far from efforts of your workgroup.  The "<strong>Election Profile</strong>" provides information
        about the election reporting you're engaged in; this could be the election itself,
        reporting dates, and more.  Below the Status and Profile, the "<strong>Election Data</strong>"
        provides details about the data of each kind that your workgroup has uploaded;
        for example, this could be voter administrative events or voter demographics.  
        This area also allows uploading of additional raw data.  Finally, your list of
        available reports is below that.  Select a report to view and choose your
        download options.</p>
